## Security

### Will I lose custody of my SOL / private keys/ wallet?
No. Sunrise Stake is a non-custodial and permissionless protocol.
Non-custodial means that your SOL is always under your control, you retain your walletâ€™s private keys, and that you can withdraw your SOL at any time.
Permissionless means that the protocol can be used by you or anyone else, without any interaction from the Sunrise team.
